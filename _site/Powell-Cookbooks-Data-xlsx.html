A philosophy major with no formal culinary training, Christopher Kostow is not your typical Napa Valley chef. While there are many popular restaurants in Napa and cookbooks about its chefs, restaurants, and cooking styles, there is no chef who is more deeply rooted in and affected by the place in which he works. Beyond the Vineyard will follow Kostow&apos;s evolution from a line cook in a seaside town to a three-Michelin-starred chef at Meadowood, a Napa Valley mainstay that the Wall Street Journal recently labeled a &quot;world class culinary splurge&quot; and &quot;temple of modern American cuisine.&quot; Through artfully constructed recipes and stories--of discovering a bounty of wild ingredients in the woods near his St. Helena home, or spending afternoons firing pottery with local ceramists--Kostow introduces readers to a new Napa, one that&apos;s rich in local flavor and a strong sense of community&quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td></td></tr>

Twitty brings a fresh perspective to our most divisive cultural issue, race, in this illuminating memoir of Southern cuisine and food culture that traces his ancestry--both black and white--through food, from Africa to America and from slavery to freedom. Southern food is integral to the American culinary tradition, yet the question of who &quot;owns&quot; it is one of the most provocative touchpoints in our ongoing struggles over race. In this unique memoir, Twitty takes readers to the white-hot center of this fight, tracing the roots of his own family and the charged politics surrounding the origins of soul food, barbecue, and all Southern cuisine. Twitty travels from the tobacco and rice farms of colonial times to plantation kitchens and backbreaking cotton fields to tell of the struggles his family faced and how food enabled his ancestors&apos; survival across three centuries. He sifts through stories, recipes, genetic tests, and historical documents, and visits Civil War battlefields in Virginia, synagogues in Alabama, and black-owned organic farms in Georgia. As he takes us through his ancestral culinary history, Twitty suggests that healing may come from embracing the discomfort of the South&apos;s past. Along the way, he reveals a truth that is more than skin deep--the power of food to bring the kin of the enslaved and their former slaveholders to the table, where they can discover the real America together.&quot;--Jacket.</td><td></td></tr>

Discomfort Food -- Guts -- Off Menu -- The Hunt -- Coda.</td><td>&quot;New Yorker writer Dana Goodyear combines the style of Mary Roach with the on-the-ground food savvy of Anthony Bourdain in a rollicking narrative look at the shocking extremes of the contemporary American food world. A new American cuisine is forming. Animals never before considered or long since forgotten are emerging as delicacies. Parts that used to be for scrap are centerpieces. Ash and hay are fashionable ingredients, and you pay handsomely to breathe flavored air. Going out to a nice dinner now often precipitates a confrontation with a fundamental question: Is that food? Dana Goodyear&apos;s anticipated debut, Anything That Moves, is simultaneously a humorous adventure, a behind-the-scenes look at, and an attempt to understand the implications of the way we eat. This is a universe populated by insect-eaters and blood drinkers, avant-garde chefs who make food out of roadside leaves and wood, and others who serve endangered species and Schedule I drugs--a cast of characters, in other words, who flirt with danger, taboo, and disgust in pursuit of the sublime. Behind them is an intricate network of scavengers, dealers, and pitchmen responsible for introducing the rare and exotic into the marketplace. This is the fringe of the modern American meal, but to judge from history, it will not be long before it reaches the family table. Anything That Moves is a highly entertaining, revelatory look into the raucous, strange, fascinatingly complex world of contemporary American food culture, and the places where the extreme is bleeding into the mainstream&quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td></td></tr>

Part reference guide, part cookbook, A Feast of Weeds encourages readers to forage diverse natural environments for food, even in our city parks and streets.    Luigi Ballerini shows tremendous breadth and depth of knowledge in an opening literary and historical analysis that explains how we have come to eat and cultivate wild plants. Each chapter that follows is devoted to a single ingredient--greens such as nettles, fennel, mint, chicory, and dandelion; and fruits such as berries, pomegranate, and prickly pear. Ballerini&apos;s delightful commentary helps foragers recognize, gather, and cook their harvest. Delicious and straightforward recipes from Southern Italy bring out the flavor and wholesomeness of each ingredient, highlighting the peasant roots of each dish.&quot;--Provided by publisher.</td><td></td></tr>

For years, we&apos;ve been told that a healthy diet is heavy on meat, poultry, and fish, and avoids carbohydrates, particularly foods high in starch--empty calories harmful to our bodies. But what if everything we&apos;ve heard was backwards? High in calories and cholesterol, animal fats and proteins too often leave you hungry and lead to overeating and weight gain. They are often the root causes of a host of avoidable health problems--from indigestion, ulcers, and constipation to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. On the other hand, complex carbohydrates like whole grains, legumes, tubers, and other starches provide your body with essential proteins and nutrients that satisfy the appetite while simultaneously fighting illness. But Americans eat far too few calories from carbohydrates--only about forty percent, according to Dr. John McDougall, internationally renowned expert on nutrition and health, featured on the documentary Forks Over Knives. The Healthiest Diet on the Planet helps us reclaim our health by enjoying nutritious starches, vegetables, and fruits. McDougall takes on the propaganda machines pushing dangerous, high-fat fad diets and cuts through the smoke and mirrors of the diet industry. He offers a clear, proven guide to what we should and shouldn&apos;t eat to prevent disease, slow the aging process, improve our physical fitness, be kind to the environment, and be our most attractive selves. Featuring two dozen color photos and mouth-watering, easy-to-follow recipes for buckwheat pancakes, breakfast tortillas, baked potato skins, rainbow risotto, red lentil soup, green enchiladas, dairy-free lasagna and pizza, and more, The Healthiest Diet on the Planet will help you look great, feel better, and forever change the way you think about health and nutrition&quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td>McDougall, Mary A.

These whole foods are packed with fiber, so not only do you tend to eat smaller portions of them naturally, but you also stay fuller, longer. These nutritious superfoods offer the essential vitamins and minerals the body needs to keep your metabolism running efficiently. Some even offer what is known as a &quot;thermogenic effect&quot;--effectively boosting your metabolism to increase the rate at which your body burns energy. And you can eat as much of them as you want! Rocco begins with a ten-day cleanse designed to kick-start weight loss and detox the body, preparing it to reap the benefits of a nutrient-rich, whole foods diet. Next comes the twenty-day meal plan, with step-by-step guidance to help you achieve maximum results. To make it easy, Rocco gives you more than seventy-five recipes for meals, snacks, smoothies, and desserts that use his Top 10 Negative Calorie Foods: almonds, apples, berries, celery, citrus fruits, cruciferous vegetables (such as cauliflower and Brussels sprouts), cucumbers, leafy greens (including Swiss chard, spinach, and kale), mushrooms, and nightshade vegetables, including peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, and more. Complete with grocery shopping lists, troubleshooting FAQs, a guide to dining out, and advice for adapting the plan for kids and families as well as vegetarian, gluten-free, and low-sugar lifestyles, The Negative Calorie Diet helps you build healthy habits to lose weight and achieve better health for a lifetime.&quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td></td></tr>

The real reason diets fail has nothing to do with calories and everything to do with the balance of bacteria in your gut. A simple guide to show you how to finally achieve your ideal weight. The 100 trillion bacteria that live in your digestive tract--which make up 90 percent of the cells in your body--are the real reason you gain or lose weight. When those microbes are out of balance, chronic health conditions can occur, including irritable bowel syndrome, fatigue, and obesity. By balancing the good and bad bacteria, you can finally achieve your ideal weight--for good. In The Skinny Gut Diet, New York Times bestselling author, public television icon, certified nutritional consultant, and digestive health expert Brenda Watson offers an insightful perspective on the little-known connection between weight gain and an underlying imbalance of bacteria in the gut, or what she calls the &quot;gut factor&quot;--the overlooked root cause of weight gain. Drawing upon the latest scientific research, Brenda illuminates the inner workings of the digestive system and provides instructions for achieving a healthy bacterial ecosystem that spurs weight loss by enabling the body to absorb fewer calories from food, experience reduced cravings, and store less fat. The premise is simple: curtail sugar consumption (and its surprising sources) and eat more healthy fats, living foods, and protein to balance the gut bacteria. The result? A skinny gut. The Skinny Gut Diet centers around an easy-to-follow diet plan. A 14-day eating plan, dozens of delicious recipes and sage advice help you achieve--and maintain--digestive balance and sustained weight loss. With inspiring real-life stories of ten individuals who transformed their health on the Skinny Gut Diet, Brenda empowers you to become your own health advocate so that you can finally shed unwanted pounds and enjoy optimal health and vitality&quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td>Smith, Leonard, 1942-</td></tr>

Breakfast treats and smoothies ; Dips and appetizers ; Main courses ; Side dishes and salads ; Breads, buns, and other doughs ; Desserts ; Beverages ; Condiments, dressings, flavorings, and pickles -- Finding your harbor of healing.</td><td>&quot;Cultured Food for Life is a part of a new genre of cookbooks gaining popularity among a growing demographic of health and wellness aficionados. In this work, fermentation guru Donna Schwenk introduces readers to the healing properties of kefir, kombucha, cultured vegetables, sprouted flour, and sourdough. Fermentation has been used in food preparation for thousands of years, but in the past few decades it has moved from being a commonplace kitchen ritual to being something done only by a few health-conscious proponents. Most fermentation now is done at factories, whose processes strip away some of the abundant vitamins, minerals, and healthy bacteria that make this way of preparing foods so beneficial. But Donna Schwenk is working to bring this staple of food preparation back to readers by showing that these now-unfamiliar processes are actually easy and fun. And by doing this, she opens the door to a world of foods that can help rid readers of health problems including high blood pressure, diabetes, allergies, acne, hypertension, asthma, and irritable bowel syndrome. After telling the astonishing story of how she healed herself and her family with these probiotic foods, Schwenk walks readers, step by step, through the basic preparation techniques for kefir, kombucha, cultured vegetables, sprouted flour, and sourdough plus more than 120 recipes that use these foods to create dishes to please any palate. With recipes like Herbed Omelet with Kefir Hollandaise Sauce, Sprouted Ginger Scones with Peaches and Kefir Cream, Kefir Veggie Sprouted Pizza, Apple Sauerkraut, and Sprouted Brownies Kefir Cupcakes, along with inspirational stories from Donna&apos;s family and friends, readers will enjoy a diet that&apos;s as delicious as it is healthy. Schwenk originally self-published a portion of this book through Balboa Press. It garnered solid sales and positive reviews&quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td></td></tr>

Now he does the same for our favorite fruit, showing us that there is indeed life beyond Red Delicious - and even Honeycrisp. While supermarkets limit their offerings to a few waxy options, apple trees with lives spanning human generations are producing characterful varieties - and now they are in the midst of a rediscovery. From heirlooms to new designer breeds, a delicious diversity of apples is out there for the eating. Apples have strong personalities, ranging from crabby to wholesome. The Black Oxford apple is actually purple, and looks like a plum. The Knobbed Russet looks like the love child of a toad and a potato. (But don&apos;t be fooled by its looks.) The D&apos;Arcy Spice leaves a hint of allspice on the tongue. Cut Hidden Rose open and its inner secret is revealed. With more than 150 art-quality color photographs, Apples of Uncommon Character shows us the fruit in all its glory. Jacobsen collected specimens both common and rare from all over North America, selecting 120 to feature, including the best varieties for eating, baking, and hard-cider making. Each is accompanied by a photograph, history, lore, and a list of characteristics. The book also includes 20 recipes, savory and sweet, resources for buying and growing, and a guide to the best apple festivals. It&apos;s a must-have for every foodie.</td><td>Barboza, Clare, photographer.</td></tr>

We learn about milk allergies, lactose intolerance, and the reasons why cheese is vital to a balanced diet.  Though he&apos;s spent 27 years studying the chemistry, biology, physics, nutrition, and even the climatology of cheese, Tunick writes for the non-scientific reader, providing an engaging and entertaining look at the science behind one of the world&apos;s favorite foods.

After water and tea, it is the most popular drink in the world, and it is at the center of a $450 billion industry. The first major reference work to investigate the history and vast scope of beer, The Oxford Companion to Beer features more than 1,100 A-Z entries written by 166 of the world&apos;s most prominent beer experts. Attractively illustrated with over 140 images, the book covers everything from the agricultural makeup of various beers to the technical elements of the brewing process, local effects of brewing on regions around the world, and the social and political implications of sharing a beer. Entries not only define terms such as &quot;dry hopping&quot; and &quot;cask conditioning&quot; but give fascinating details about how these and other techniques affect a beer&apos;s taste, texture, and popularity. Cultural entries shed light on such topics as pub games, food pairings and the development of beer styles. Readers will enjoy vivid accounts of how our drinking traditions have changed throughout history, and how these traditions vary in different parts of the world, from Japan to Mexico, New Zealand, and Brazil, among many other countries. The pioneers of beer-making are the subjects of biographical entries, and the legacies these pioneers have left behind, in the form of the world&apos;s most popular beers and breweries, are recurrent themes throughout the book. Packed with information, this comprehensive resource also includes thorough appendices (covering beer festivals, beer magazines, and more), conversion tables, and an index. Featuring a foreword by Tom Colicchio, this book is the perfect shelf-mate to Oxford&apos;s renowned Companion to Wine and an absolutely indispensable volume for everyone who loves beer as well as all beverage professionals, including home brewers, restaurateurs, journalists, cooking school instructors, beer importers, distributors, and retailers, and a host of others&quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td></td></tr>

Potatoes cooked with schmaltz take on a crispness and satisfying flavor that vegetable oil can&apos;t produce.

What do coffee, IPA beer, dark chocolate, and radicchio all have in common? They&apos;re bitter. In this deep and fascinating exploration of bitter through science, culture, history, and 120 deliciously idiosyncratic recipes, award-winning author Jennifer McLagan makes a case for this misunderstood flavor. Biologically-speaking, the taste of something bitter--unlike sweet, which can indicate a nutrient-rich food, and salty, which indicates the presence of needed minerals--can signify a poison, so an appreciation for bitterness must develop with age and experience. Bitter is a known appetite stimulant and is often just the thing to add dimension and balance to a dish. While some culinary cultures, such as in Italy and parts of Asia, have an inherent appreciation for bitter flavors (think Campari and Chinese bitter melon), little attention has been given to bitterness in North America: we&apos;re much more likely to reach for salty or sweet. However, even in North America, bitter is making inroads with increased interest in cocktail bitters, craft beers, and artisanal coffee; and consumption of bitter salad greens and chocolate is growing. In the capable hands of McLagan, bitterness will emerge from the shadows of the culinary underworld and get its deserved place in the spotlight&quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td>Brackett, Aya.</td></tr>

Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarbrough bring these unheralded culinary superstars to the center of the plate, with more than 100 recipes showing that their range of textures and flavors is greater than any other food group, they&apos;re incredibly versatile, they&apos;re economical, and they can anchor a meal. Readers will be surprised at how easily and creatively whole grains can be used as the base for breakfast, dessert, and elegant entrees: Baked Barley Grits with Apples and Sausage will far outdo the standard cornmeal; and Millet Burgers with Olives, Sun-dried Tomatoes, and Pecorino won&apos;t leave anyone missing the meat. Tips on quick-cooking grains or precooking ahead of time make cooking with these hearty staples practical for weeknights, and many are appropriate (or can be modified) for vegetarian and vegan diets. Grain Mains is a modern manifesto for whole grains, with inventive and tantalizing recipes&quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td>Scarbrough, Mark.</td></tr>

The food editors -- often a mix of trained journalist and home economist -- reported on everything from nutrition news to features on the new chef in town. They wrote recipes and solicited ideas from readers. The sections reflected the trends of the time and the cooks of the community. The editors were local celebrities, judging cooking contests and getting calls at home about how to prepare a Thanksgiving turkey. They were consumer advocates and reporters for food safety and nutrition. They helped make James Beard and Julia Child household names as the editors wrote about their television appearances and reviewed their cookbooks. These food editors laid the foundation for the food community that Nora Ephron described in her classic 1968 essay, &quot;The Food Establishment,&quot; and eventually led to the food communities of today.</td><td></td></tr>

Hailed by Time magazine as &quot;a minor masterpiece&quot; when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they&apos;re made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as &quot;molecular gastronomy.&quot; Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. Among the major themes addressed throughout this new edition are: Traditional and modern methods of food production and their influences on food quality, the great diversity of methods by which people in different places and times have prepared the same ingredients, tips for selecting the best ingredients and preparing them successfully, the particular substances that give foods their flavors and that give us pleasure, and our evolving knowledge of the health benefits and risks of foods. On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food.</td><td></td></tr>

Organized by main ingredient--chicken, meat, fish and seafood, eggs, pasta and noodles, tofu, vegetable dinners, grains, pizza, soups, and salads that mean it--Dinner covers an astonishing breadth of recipes. There is something for every mood, season, and the amount of time you have: sheet pan chicken laced with spicy harissa, burgers amped with chorizo, curried lentils with poached eggs; and if you want just a little something else, you&apos;ll find green beans with caper vinaigrette, coconut rice, and skillet brown-butter cornbread, to name just a few dishes in this indispensable collection. Here, too, are easy flourishes that make dinner exceptional: stir charred lemon into pasta, toss creamy Caesar-like dressing on a grain bowl, add fresh ricotta and demerara sugar to stovetop mac and cheese; lavish a dollop of chili paste just about anywhere. Melissa Clark, the New York Times bestselling author and one of the most beloved food writers of our generation, has written a comprehensive and practical book that reflects the way she cooks at home for her family and on those rare nights when she&apos;s alone.</td><td></td></tr>

If you&apos;ve ever found yourself stuck in front of the stove at your own party, scrambling to get everything to the table at just the right moment, Ina is here to let you in on her secrets! Thanks to twenty years of running a specialty food store and fifteen years writing cookbooks, she has learned exactly which dishes you can prep, assemble, or cook ahead of time. Whether you&apos;re hosting a party or simply making dinner on a hectic weeknight, Ina gives you lots of amazing recipes that taste just as good--or even better!--when they&apos;re made in advance. In Make It Ahead, each recipe includes clear instructions for what you can do ahead of time, and how far in advance, so you can cook with confidence and eliminate last-minute surprises. Make a pitcher of Summer Rose Sangria filled with red berries, let it chill overnight for the flavors to develop, and you have a delicious drink to offer your friends the minute they arrive. Simmer a pot of Wild Mushroom &amp; Farro Soup, enjoy a bowl for lunch, and freeze the rest for a chilly evening. You can prep the kale, Brussels sprouts, and lemon vinaigrette for Winter Slaw ahead of time and simply toss them together before serving. Assemble French Chicken Pot Pies filled with artichokes and fresh tarragon a day in advance and then pop them in the oven half an hour before dinner. And for dessert, everyone needs the recipe for Ina&apos;s Decadent (gluten-free!) Chocolate Cake topped with Make-Ahead Whipped Cream. Ina also includes recipes for the biggest cooking day of the year--Thanksgiving! Her Ultimate Make-Ahead Roast Turkey and Gravy with Onions &amp; Sage may just change your life.

It also meant the outfits they wore to dinner, the decor of the restaurant, and the guest list at their dinner party. Actually, food permeated every aspect of their lives. With inherent interests in fashion, design, media, and celebrity, they realized nobody was ever looking at these categories through the lens of food.

In launching the website, Danielle and Laura not only got to talk about food all the time, but they also collected a trove of hilarious experiences in brushing elbows with celebrities from all walks of life.

No one was more stunned by this unexpected turn of events than its editor in chief, Ruth Reichl, who suddenly faced an uncertain professional future. As she struggled to process what had seemed unthinkable, Reichl turned to the one place that had always provided sanctuary. &quot;I did what I always do when I&apos;m confused, lonely, or frightened,&quot; she writes. &quot;I disappeared into the kitchen.&quot;  My Kitchen Year follows the change of seasons -- and Reichl&apos;s emotions -- as she slowly heals through the simple pleasures of cooking. While working 24/7, Reichl would &quot;throw quick meals together&quot; for her family and friends. Now she has the time to rediscover what cooking meant to her. Over the course of this challenging year, each dish Reichl prepares becomes a kind of stepping stone to finding joy again in ordinary things. The 136 recipes collected here represent a life&apos;s passion for food: a blistering ma po tofu that shakes Reichl out of the blues; a decadent grilled cheese sandwich that accompanies a rare sighting in the woods around her home; a rhubarb sundae that signals the arrival of spring. Here, too, is Reichl&apos;s enlivening dialogue with her Twitter followers, who become her culinary supporters and lively confidants. Part cookbook, part memoir, part paean to the household gods, My Kitchen Year reveals a refreshingly vulnerable side of the world&apos;s most famous food editor as she shares treasured recipes to be returned to again and again and again.</td><td></td></tr>

Determined not to let their relationship deteriorate into that of &quot;roommates with children,&quot; they institute a weekly date night: they saute��, roast, mix and dice and spend time reconnecting over simple but thoughtful dishes like Crostini with Ricotta, Prosciutto, and Peas, Tomato and Fennel Gazpacho with Dungeness Crab, Fennel-Crusted Lamb Chops, and Dulce de Leche and Nectarine Creamsicles (sometimes even with an expertly chilled cocktail). Just carving out time to talk, cook, and eat together became the marriage-booster they needed, and now with Date Night In she invites you to make date night an integral part of your week and shows you how to woo your partner all over again with food, drink, and conversation.</td><td></td></tr>

Gathered at these tables were many of the great figures in art, literature and economics in the early twentieth century: E.M. Forster, Roger Fry, J.M. Keynes, Lytton Strachey and Virginia Woolf, among many others. Each chapter comprises a series of narratives, many of which are enhanced with an appropriate recipe, along with sketches, paintings, photographs, letters and handwritten notes, and featuring original quotations throughout.

This carefully researched cookbook presents 150 authentic recipes from across the United Sates incorporating many indigenous ingredients hailed today for their healthfulness and flavor--wild rice, corn, beans, sunflower seeds, venison, buffalo, fowl, and fish. Spirit of the Harvest features traditional dishes from the Cherokee, Chippewa, Navajo, Sioux, Mohegan, Iroquois, Comanche, Hopi, Haida, and many other North American tribes. Among them are recipes for such varied dishes as Cherokee Red and Green Mixit, Choctaw File-Crawfish Stew, Wild Rice and Venison Stuffed Pumpkin, Indian Tacos, Navajo Peach Crisp, Roast Duck Stuffed with Wild Rice and Wild Muschrooms, Elk Stew with Acorn Dumplings, Smoked Salmon soup, Ember Roasted Buffalo, Skokomish Steamed Seafood, Mohegan Succotash, Iroquois Leaf Bread, and Whipped Raspberries and Honey. Many recipes come from noted cooks who are members of the different tribes, and all recipes can be easily prepared using modern kitchen techniques. Fifty full-color photographs featuring an array of historic Indian artifacts illustrate these recipes, which originated in points across the United States from Cape Cod to Puget sound, from the Missouri River to the Gulf of Mexico and the Rio Grande. A specially created map places the tribes and their principal foods in geographical context. Each chapter is introduced by an expert on the Indians of the region, and discusses the cultures of major tribal groups, their diets, their ceremonial use of food, and the historic dishes they developed.</td><td>Jacobs, Martin.</td></tr>

Through Eighmey&apos;s eyes and culinary research and experiments--including sleuthing for Lincoln&apos;s grocery bills in Springfield ledgers and turning a backyard grill into a cast-iron stove--the foods that Lincoln enjoyed, cooked, or served are translated into modern recipes so that authentic meals and foods of 1820-1865 are possible for home cooks.

Their singular and original approach to cooking, which expertly blends seemingly disparate influences, flavors, and textures, is a style that has influenced other restaurants throughout the country and is beloved by diners, chefs, and critics alike. In the debut cookbook from this acclaimed restaurant, Brioza and Krasinski share recipes for their most popular dishes along with stunning photography, and inspire readers to craft an unforgettable meal of textures, temperatures, aromas, and colors that excite all of the senses&quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td>Krasinski, Nicole, author.</td></tr>

Goldstein&apos;s interviews with almost two hundred chefs, purveyors, artisans, winemakers, and food writers bring to life an era when cooking was grounded in passion, bold innovation, and a dedication to &quot;flavor first.&quot; The author shows how the counterculture movement in the West gave rise to a restaurant culture that was defined by open kitchens, women in leadership positions, and the presence of a surprising number of chefs and artisanal food producers who lacked formal training. California cuisine challenged the conventional kitchen hierarchy and dominance of French technique in fine dining, she explains, leading to a more egalitarian restaurant culture and informal food scene. In weaving the author&apos;s view of California food culture with profiles of those who played a part in its development-from Alice Waters to Bill Niman to Wolfgang Puck-Inside the California Food Revolution demonstrates that, in addition to access to fresh produce, the region also shared a distinctly Western culture of openness, creativity, and collaboration. Wonderfully detailed and engagingly written, this book elucidates as never before how the inspirations that emerged in California went on to transform the eating experience throughout the U.S. and the world. &quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td>Brown, Dore, 1956-</td></tr>

Trisha wants to feed her loved ones -- and yours, too -- food that both tastes good and is good for you.</td><td>Bernard, Beth Yearwood, author.</td></tr>

Diaz discovers the connections between the food she grew up eating in Atlanta and the African and indigenous influences in so many Puerto Rican dishes. With stunning photographs that showcase the geographic diversity of the island and the vibrant ingredients that make up Puerto Rican cuisine, this cookbook is a moving story about discovering our roots through the foods that comfort us.

But the new British food revolution is not limited to fine restaurants and television. Within Britain, pub and country inn chefs, newspaper and magazine food writers, and everyday home cooks are taking a renewed interest in their own traditional cuisine, at long last approaching it with more pride than with prejudice. In The Ploughman&apos;s Lunch and the Miser&apos;s Feast, the American cookbook author, travel writer and professional photographer Brian Yarvin brings these newly rediscovered pleasures to the attention of home cooks on this side of the Atlantic. In 100 recipes, 65 color photos, and dozens of lively sidebars, Yarvin reveals what he has discovered in his numerous walking and driving trips across the length and breadth of Great Britain. His recipes emphasize traditional and down-home dishes as perfected and updated by the best cooks in Britain. They include lots of pub fare, like Fish and Chips, Shepherd&apos;s Pie, Ploughman&apos;s Lunch, and a host of savory cakes and pasties. There are festive and substantial main courses like Howtowdie, Poached Salmon with White Sauce, and, of course, a splendidly done Beef Wellington. The hard-working Brits love big breakfasts, and there is a chapter devoted to those, while another chapter celebrates the sandwiches, salads, and snacks that are served at tea time. Curry shops have been ubiquitous for so long that Indian food by now is properly British, and Yarvin devotes another chapter to dishes such as Shrimp Biryani and Chicken Korma. A big chapter, too, shows us how to make the best-loved British sweets, from the humbly named Plum Pudding and Mincemeat Cake to the amusingly monikered Fast Rascals, Kentish Huffkins, and Welsh Dripping Cake&quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td></td></tr>

Through a variety of personal anecdotes and flavorful recipes, Viestad shares his philosophy of cooking as he shows us the best way to cure gravlaks, make our own butter, prepare a midsummer night&apos;s feast of poached salmon, even how to flambe a pork tenderloin with Scandinavia&apos;s favorite spirit -- aquavit.</td><td>Randem, Mette.</td></tr>

Twenty-five years later, much has changed.  Japanese food is a favorite of diners around the world.  Not only is sushi as much a part of the Western culinary scene as burgers, bagels, and burritos, but some Japanese chefs have become household names.  Japanese flavors, ingredients, and textures have been fused into dishes from a wide variety of other cuisines.  What hasn&apos;t changed over the years, however, are the foundations of Japanese cooking.  When he originally wrote Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art, Shizuo Tsuji, a scholar who trained under famous European chefs, was so careful and precise in his descriptions of the cuisine and its vital philosophies, and so thoughtful in his choice of dishes and recipes, that his words-and the dishes they help produce-are as fresh today as when they were first written.  The 25th Anniversary edition celebrates Tsuji&apos;s classic work.  Building on M.F.K. Fisher&apos;s eloquent introduction, the volume now includes a thought-provoking new Foreword by Gourmet Editor-in-Chief Ruth Reichl and a new preface by the author&apos;s son and Tsuji Culinary Institute Director Yoshiki Tsuji.  Beautifully illustrated with eight pages of new color photos and over 500 drawings, and containing 230 traditional recipes as well as detailed explanations of ingredients, kitchen utensils, techniques and cultural aspects of Japanese cuisine, this edition continues the Tsuji legacy of bringing the Japanese kitchen within the reach of Western cooks.</td><td>Sutherland, Mary, 1947-</td></tr>

Ricker&apos;s traditional take on Thai food soon drew the notice of the New York Times and Gourmet magazine, establishing him as a culinary star. Now, with his first cookbook, Ricker tackles head-on the myths that keep people from making Thai food at home: that it&apos;s too spicy for the American palate or too difficult to source ingredients. Fifty knockout recipes for simple and delicious Thai dishes range from Grilled Pork Collar with Spicy Dipping Sauce and Iced Greens to Andy&apos;s now-famous Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings.

The word mezze stems from the Arabic term tamazzaza--a single word that broadly embraces the idea of enjoying small portions of food and taking the time to indulge one&apos;s taste buds, eyes, and nose by exposing them to a wide range of aromas and flavors. A complete mezze table is formed when many of these warm and cold dishes are presented together, as a meal in itself. The mezze culture originated in the Ottoman Empire and can be found in the whole of the Levantine Mediterranean: from Greece and Cyprus to Turkey, Palestine, Jordan, and Syria. But it is Lebanon, the cultural home of the authors, which has really developed and is famed for the richest, most extensive, and most sophisticated mezze culture. In addition to the 100 classic and contemporary mezze recipes, Souk also delves into the personal stories and reminiscences about this food tradition and the families and friends the authors meet along the way. Eating mezze is a social event, wrapped in warmth and coziness, and spiced with waves of laughter and noisy chatter.&quot;-- from amazon.com</td><td>Tol, Merijn, author.</td></tr>

In an evocative and enlightening introduction, Ellis delights readers with biscuit history and its intimate connections with southern culture and foodways.

For a long time, brassicas had a mixed reputation. While a small group of people staunchly adored them, most Americans were not as fond of the vegetables formerly known as &quot;cruciferous&quot; (who doesn&apos;t remember a plate of stinky boiled cabbage or President Bush&apos;s condemnation of broccoli?). But in recent years, a transformation has occurred. Kale has taken the world by storm and there&apos;s hardly a restaurant left that doesn&apos;t have brussels sprouts on the menu. The rising popularity of brassicas is not only due to their extraordinary health benefits and &quot;superfood&quot; status, but also the realization that they can taste delicious when properly prepared. Brassicas shows home cooks how to bring out the flavors of these vegetables without death-by-boiling or burial under a blanket of cheese. When roasted, brassicas reveal an inherent sweetness. In a fresh salad or saute, they add a delightful peppery punch.

While his father improbably launched a series of successful seafood and steak restaurants, the author burned his way through American culture, obsessing over football, fighting the all-American boys who called him a chink, partied like a gremlin, sold drugs with his crew, and idolized Tupac. His anchor through it all was food. After misadventures as a lawyer, street fashion renegade, and stand-up comic, he finally threw everything he loved into his own restaurant, bringing together a legacy stretching back to China and the shards of global culture he had melded into his own identity.</td><td></td></tr>

She evinced enthusiasm about Brandon&apos;s enthusiasms: building a violin, building a boat, and opening an ice cream store--none of which came to pass. So when Brandon started making plans to open a pizza restaurant, Molly felt sure that the restaurant would join the list of Brandon&apos;s abandoned projects. When she finally realized that Delancey really was going to happen, that Brandon was going to change all of her assumptions about what their married life would be like, it was too late. She faced the first crisis in their young marriage. Opening a restaurant is not like hosting a dinner party every night. Molly and Brandon&apos;s budget was small, and the tasks at hand were often overhwelming. They had to find a space they could afford, gut renovate it themselves, find second-hand furniture and equipment, build what furniture they couldn&apos;t find, buy and install a wood-burning oven, pass health inspections, hire staff, and establish a billing and payroll system. They lost a financial partner. Their cook disappeared the day they opened. Still, their restaurant was a success, and Molly managed to convince herself that she was happy in their new life. Until Halloween night, when she was forced to admit she could no longer pretend. While Delancey is a funny and frank look at behind-the-scenes restaurant life, it is also a bravely honest and moving portrait of a tender young marriage and two partners who had to find out how to let each other go in order to come together&quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td></td></tr>

What do coffee, IPA beer, dark chocolate, and radicchio all have in common? They&apos;re bitter. In this deep and fascinating exploration of bitter through science, culture, history, and 120 deliciously idiosyncratic recipes, award-winning author Jennifer McLagan makes a case for this misunderstood flavor. Biologically-speaking, the taste of something bitter--unlike sweet, which can indicate a nutrient-rich food, and salty, which indicates the presence of needed minerals--can signify a poison, so an appreciation for bitterness must develop with age and experience. Bitter is a known appetite stimulant and is often just the thing to add dimension and balance to a dish. While some culinary cultures, such as in Italy and parts of Asia, have an inherent appreciation for bitter flavors (think Campari and Chinese bitter melon), little attention has been given to bitterness in North America: we&apos;re much more likely to reach for salty or sweet. However, even in North America, bitter is making inroads with increased interest in cocktail bitters, craft beers, and artisanal coffee; and consumption of bitter salad greens and chocolate is growing. In the capable hands of McLagan, bitterness will emerge from the shadows of the culinary underworld and get its deserved place in the spotlight&quot;-- Provided by publisher.</td><td>Brackett, Aya.</td></tr>

This book explores the rich story of Christmas food and feasting, tracing the history of how our festive menu evolved and inherited elements of pagan ritual, medieval traditions, early modern innovations, Victorian romanticism, and contemporary commercialism. Although it makes reference to global traditions, it focuses specifically on the story of how the British Christmas meal evolved, both on its native shores and beyond. It considers the origins, form, and structure of the modern British Christmas dinner, with its codified menu and iconic festive dishes and drinks. 0It also tells the story of what happened to that meal as it was taken throughout the Empire, becoming entrenched in places most strongly associated with the British Diaspora. In these places, spread across the Globe, keeping a very precise model of Christmas became a key marker of cultural identity. This British Christmas was not unchanging, though; rather, it adapted to new environments, and merged with the Christmases of other cultures encountered to create new traditions. Looking beyond Britain, to places strongly associated with its Diaspora, such as the United States of America, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, helps us to understand the cultural significance and meaning of this feast with more complexity. With recipes and menus, this work will help modern readers understand the feasts of Christmas past, and perhaps incorporate some of those old dishes into Christmas-present festivities.</td><td></td></tr>

Whether cooking for two, four, or for your own (portion sizes included!) underground operation, Adventures in Starry Kitchen is a fully illustrated, hilarious, and gorgeously rendered how-to manual for accomplished and aspiring at-home chefs alike.&quot;--Back cover.</td><td></td></tr>
